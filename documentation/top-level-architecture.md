## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers
- Modular design with well-defined interfaces
- Independent deployment of services

### 2. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support through containerization
- Stateless service design
- Efficient caching mechanisms

### 3. Reliability
- Fault tolerance through retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation during network issues
- Comprehensive error handling

### 4. Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure communication protocols

### 5. Maintainability
- Comprehensive documentation
- Standardized API design
- Automated testing and deployment
